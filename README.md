# Cybercrime Data Analysis (2023–24)

This project analyzes Australian cybercrime data from the 2023–24 financial year to uncover trends in attack types, victim groups, and financial impact across sectors. The goal is to visualize key insights and demonstrate proficiency in data collection, analysis, and reporting using tools commonly found in a data analyst’s toolkit.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Identify the most reported types of cyberattacks.
- Understand which victim groups (individuals vs businesses) were most impacted.
- Highlight sectors with the highest financial costs.
- Practice using SQL, Python, and Excel for end-to-end data analysis.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (JupyterLab): Data visualization using `matplotlib` & `pandas`.
- **SQLite**: Performed custom queries for summarization and aggregation.
- **Excel**: Cleaned and formatted data, created charts and visuals.
- **DB Browser for SQLite**: GUI interface for executing and testing SQL queries.
